-- get the total power of the formant
-- voiced formants will have higher (bandPower/totalPower), examine the max of those

TODO
====

* Tween the playback frequency
* Improve the synthesis -- formants should start as 2 neighboring overtones
* Fix the unvoiced audio width, it's too noisy right now
* editing controls
* less audio latency
