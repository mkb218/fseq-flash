TODO
====

* Tween the playback frequency
* Improve the synthesis -- formants should start as 2 neighboring overtones
* the display should be a class, and have two subclasses for the draggable regions
* Fix the unvoiced audio width, it's too noisy right now
* editing controls
* "undo" system -- save each edit in memory
* less audio latency
